\arguments{
\item{U}{U is either a data class of exametrika, or raw data. When raw data is given,
it is converted to the exametrika class with the \link{dataFormat} function.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{seed}{seed for random.}

\item{ncls}{number of latent class(rank). The default is 2.}

\item{method}{specify the model to analyze the data.Local dependence latent
class model is set to "C", latent rank model is set "R". The default is "R".}

\item{population}{Population size. The default is 20}

\item{Rs}{Survival Rate. The default is 0.5}

\item{Rm}{Mutation Rate. The default is 0.002}

\item{successiveLimit}{Termination conditions. If the optimal individual does not change
for this number of generations, it is considered to have converged.}

\item{elitism}{Number of elites that remain without crossover when transitioning to
the next generation.}

\item{alpha}{Learning rate. The default is 0.05}

\item{estimate}{In PBIL for estimating the adjacency matrix, specify by number from the
following four methods: 1. Optimal adjacency matrix, 2. Rounded average of individuals in
the last generation, 3. Rounded average of survivors in the last generation, 4. Rounded
generational gene of the last generation. The default is 1.}

\description{
Generating DAG list from data using Population-Based Incremental learning
}
\details{
This function performs structural learning for each classes by using
the Population-Based Incremental Learning model(PBIL) proposed by
Fukuda et al.(2014) within the genetic algorithm framework.
Instead of learning the adjacency matrix itself, the 'genes of genes'
that generate the adjacency matrix are updated with each generation.
For more details, please refer to Fukuda(2014) and Section
9.4.3 of the text(Shojima,2022).
