## Model Overview

### Local Dependence Models

The package implements three complementary approaches to modeling local dependencies in test data:

1. **LDLRA (Local Dependence Latent Rank Analysis)**
   - Analyzes how item dependencies change across different proficiency ranks
   - Suitable when item relationships are expected to vary by student ability level
   - Combines the strengths of LRA and Bayesian Networks

2. **LDB (Local Dependence Biclustering)**
   - Focuses on relationships between item fields within each rank
   - Optimal when items naturally form groups (fields) with hierarchical relationships
   - Integrates biclustering with field-level dependency structures

3. **BINET (Bicluster Network Model)**
   - Examines class transitions within each field
   - Best for understanding complex patterns of class progression
   - Combines biclustering with class-level network analysis

  - 0: Incorrect answer
  - 1: Correct answer
- Polytomous data
  - Ordinal response categories
  - Multiple score levels
- Missing values
  - NA values supported
  - Custom missing value codes can be specified

### Input Data Specifications

The package accepts data in several formats with the following features:

1. **Data Structure**
   - Matrix or data.frame format
   - Response data (binary or polytomous)
   - Flexible handling of missing values
   - Support for various data types and structures

2. **Optional Components**
   - Examinee ID column (default: first column)

Note: Some analysis methods may have specific data type requirements. Please refer to each function's documentation for detailed requirements.

### Data Formatting

The `dataFormat` function preprocesses input data for analysis:

- **Functions**
  - Extracts and validates ID vectors if present
  - Processes item labels or assigns sequential numbers
  - Creates response data matrix U
  - Generates missing value indicator matrix Z
  - Handles item weights
  - Converts data to appropriate format for analysis

Example:
```{r example-data-format}
# Format raw data for analysis
data <- dataFormat(J15S500) # Using sample dataset
str(data) # View structure of formatted data
```

### Sample Datasets

The package includes various sample datasets from Shojima (2022) for testing and learning:

- **Naming Convention**: JxxSxxx format
  - J: Number of items (e.g., J15 = 15 items)
  - S: Sample size (e.g., S500 = 500 examinees)

Available datasets:

## Examples

### Test Statistics

```{r results-test-statistics, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
TestStatistics(J15S500)
```

### ItemStatistics

```{r results-item-statistics, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ItemStatistics(J15S500)
```

### CTT

```{r results-ctt, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
CTT(J15S500)
```

### IRT

The IRT function estimates the number of parameters using a logistic model, which can be specified using the `model` option. It supports 2PL, 3PL, and 4PL models.

```{r model-irt, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
result.IRT <- IRT(J15S500, model = 3)
result.IRT
```

The estimated population of subjects is included in the returned object.
```{r results-irt-ability, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(result.IRT$ability)
```


The plots offer options for Item Characteristic Curves (ICC), Item Information Curves (IIC), and Test Information Curves (TIC), which can be specified through options. Items can be specified using the `items` argument, and if not specified, plots will be drawn for all items. The number of rows and columns for dividing the plotting area can be specified using `nr` and `nc`, respectively.

```{r plot-irt-curves, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(result.IRT, type = "ICC", items = 1:6, nc = 2, nr = 3)
plot(result.IRT, type = "IIC", items = 1:6, nc = 2, nr = 3)
plot(result.IRT, type = "TIC")
```

### LCA Example

Latent Class Analysis requires specifying the dataset and the number of classes.

```{r model-lca, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
LCA(J15S500, ncls = 5)
```

The returned object contains the Class Membership Matrix, which indicates which latent class each subject belongs to. The Estimate includes the one with the highest membership probability.

```{r results-lca-membership, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
result.LCA <- LCA(J15S500, ncls = 5)
head(result.LCA$Students)
```

The plots offer options for IRP, CMP, TRP, and LCD. For more details on each, please refer to Shojima (2022).

```{r plot-lca, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(result.LCA, type = "IRP", items = 1:6, nc = 2, nr = 3)
plot(result.LCA, type = "CMP", students = 1:9, nc = 3, nr = 3)
plot(result.LCA, type = "TRP")
plot(result.LCA, type = "LCD")
```

### LRA Example

Latent Rank Analysis requires specifying the dataset and the number of classes.

```{r model-lra, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
LRA(J15S500, nrank = 6)
```

The estimated subject rank membership probabilities and plots are almost the same as those in LCA (Latent Class Analysis). Since a ranking is assumed for the latent classes, rank-up odds and rank-down odds are calculated.

```{r results-lra-membership, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
result.LRA <- LRA(J15S500, nrank = 6)
head(result.LRA$Students)
```

```{r plot-lra, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(result.LRA, type = "IRP", items = 1:6, nc = 2, nr = 3)
plot(result.LRA, type = "RMP", students = 1:9, nc = 3, nr = 3)
plot(result.LRA, type = "TRP")
plot(result.LRA, type = "LRD")
```

### Biclustering/Ranklustering

Biclustering and Ranklustering algorithms are almost the same, differing only in whether they include a filtering matrix or not. The difference is specified using the `method` option in the `Biclustering()` function. For more details, please refer to the help documentation.

```{r}
Biclustering(J35S515, nfld = 5, ncls = 6, method = "B")
```


```{r}
result.Ranklustering <- Biclustering(J35S515, nfld = 5, ncls = 6, method = "R")
plot(result.Ranklustering, type = "Array")
plot(result.Ranklustering, type = "FRP", nc = 2, nr = 3)
plot(result.Ranklustering, type = "RMP", students = 1:9, nc = 3, nr = 3)
plot(result.Ranklustering, type = "LRD")
```

To find the optimal number of classes and the optimal number of fields, the Infinite Relational Model is available.

```{r}
result.IRM <- IRM(J35S515, gamma_c = 1, gamma_f = 1, verbose = TRUE)
plot(result.IRM, type = "Array")
plot(result.IRM, type = "FRP", nc = 3)
plot(result.IRM, type = "TRP")
```

Additionally, supplementary notes on the derivation of the Infinite Relational Model with Chinese restaurant process is [here](https://kosugitti.github.io/kosugitti10/notes/IRM_memo.pdf).

### Bayesian Network Model

The Bayesian network model is a model that represents the conditional probabilities between items in a network format based on the pass rates of the items. By providing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) between items externally, it calculates the conditional probabilities based on the specified graph. The igraph package is used for the analysis and representation of the network.

There are three ways to specify the graph. You can either pass a matrix-type DAG to the argument adj_matrix, pass a DAG described in a CSV file to the argument adj_file, or pass a graph-type object g used in the igraph package to the argument g.

The methods to create the matrix-type adj_matrix and the graph object g are as follows:

```{r setup-igraph, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
DAG <-
  matrix(
    c(
      "Item01", "Item02",
      "Item02", "Item03",
      "Item02", "Item04",
      "Item03", "Item05",
      "Item04", "Item05"
    ),
    ncol = 2, byrow = T
  )
## graph object
g <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(DAG)
g
## Adjacency matrix
adj_mat <- as.matrix(igraph::get.adjacency(g))
print(adj_mat)
```

A CSV file with the same information as the graph above in the following format. The first line contains column names (headers) and will not be read as data.

```{r print-dag, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cat("From,To\n")
for (i in 1:nrow(DAG)) {
  cat(sprintf("%s,%s\n", DAG[i, 1], DAG[i, 2]))
}
```

While only one specification is sufficient, if multiple specifications are provided, they will be prioritized in the order of file, matrix, and graph object.

An example of executing BNM by providing a graph structure (DAG) is as follows:

```{r model-bnm, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
result.BNM <- BNM(J5S10, adj_matrix = adj_mat)
result.BNM
```

#### Structure Learning for Bayesian network with GA

The function searches for a DAG suitable for the data using a genetic algorithm. A best DAG is not necessarily identified. Instead of exploring all combinations of nodes and edges, only the space topologically sorted by the pass rate, namely the upper triangular matrix of the adjacency matrix, is explored. For interpretability, the number of parent nodes should be limited. A null model is not proposed. Utilize the content of the items and the experience of the questioner to aid in interpreting the results. For more details, please refer to Section 8.5 of the text(Shojima,2022).

Please note that the GA may take a considerable amount of time, depending on the number of items and the size of the population.

```{r model-ga-bnm, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
StrLearningGA_BNM(J5S10,
  population = 20, Rs = 0.5, Rm = 0.002, maxParents = 2,
  maxGeneration = 100, crossover = 2, elitism = 2
)
```

The method of Population-Based incremental learning proposed by Fukuda (2014) can also be used for learning. This method has several variations for estimating the optimal adjacency matrix at the end, which can be specified as options. See help or text Section 8.5.2.

```{r model-pbil-bnm, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
StrLearningPBIL_BNM(J5S10,
  population = 20, Rs = 0.5, Rm = 0.005, maxParents = 2,
  alpha = 0.05, estimate = 4
)
```

### Local Dependence Latent Rank Analysis

LD-LRA is an analysis that combines LRA and BNM, and it is used to analyze the network structure among items in the latent rank. In this function, structural learning is not performed, so you need to provide item graphs for each rank as separate files.

For each class, it is necessary to specify a graph, and there are three ways to do so. You can either pass a matrix-type DAG for each class or a list of graph-type objects used in the igraph package to the arguments adj_list or g_list, respectively, or you can provide a DAG described in a CSV file. The way to specify it in a CSV file is as follows.

```{r setup-dag-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
DAG_dat <- matrix(c(
  "From", "To", "Rank",
  "Item01", "Item02", 1,
  "Item04", "Item05", 1,
  "Item01", "Item02", 2,
  "Item02", "Item03", 2,
  "Item04", "Item05", 2,
  "Item08", "Item09", 2,
  "Item08", "Item10", 2,
  "Item09", "Item10", 2,
  "Item08", "Item11", 2,
  "Item01", "Item02", 3,
  "Item02", "Item03", 3,
  "Item04", "Item05", 3,
  "Item08", "Item09", 3,
  "Item08", "Item10", 3,
  "Item09", "Item10", 3,
  "Item08", "Item11", 3,
  "Item02", "Item03", 4,
  "Item04", "Item06", 4,
  "Item04", "Item07", 4,
  "Item05", "Item06", 4,
  "Item05", "Item07", 4,
  "Item08", "Item10", 4,
  "Item08", "Item11", 4,
  "Item09", "Item11", 4,
  "Item02", "Item03", 5,
  "Item04", "Item06", 5,
  "Item04", "Item07", 5,
  "Item05", "Item06", 5,
  "Item05", "Item07", 5,
  "Item09", "Item11", 5,
  "Item10", "Item11", 5,
  "Item10", "Item12", 5
), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# save csv file
edgeFile <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
write.csv(DAG_dat, edgeFile, row.names = FALSE, quote = TRUE)
```

Here, it is shown an example of specifying with matrix-type and graph objects using the aforementioned CSV file. While only one specification is sufficient, if multiple specifications are provided, they will be prioritized in the order of file, matrix, and graph object.

```{r setup-graph-conversion, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
g_csv <- read.csv(edgeFile)
colnames(g_csv) <- c("From", "To", "Rank")
adj_list <- list()
g_list <- list()
for (i in 1:5) {
  adj_R <- g_csv[g_csv$Rank == i, 1:2]
  g_tmp <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(adj_R)
  adj_tmp <- igraph::get.adjacency(g_tmp)
  g_list[[i]] <- g_tmp
  adj_list[[i]] <- adj_tmp
}
## Example of graph list
g_list
```

```{r results-adj-list, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
### Example of adjacency list
adj_list
```

The example of running the LDLRA function using this CSV file would look like this.

```{r model-ldlra, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
result.LDLRA <- LDLRA(J12S5000,
  ncls = 5,
  adj_file = edgeFile
)
result.LDLRA
```

Of course, it also supports various types of plots.
```{r plot-ldlra, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(result.LDLRA, type = "IRP", nc = 4, nr = 3)
plot(result.LDLRA, type = "TRP")
plot(result.LDLRA, type = "LRD")
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
# Clean up temporary file
unlink(edgeFile)
```

#### Structure Learning for LDLRA with GA(PBIL)

You can learn item-interaction graphs for each rank using the PBIL algorithm. In addition to various options, the learning process requires a very long computation time. It's also important to note that the result is merely one of the feasible solutions, and it's not necessarily the optimal solution.

```{r model-pbil-ldlra, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=T}
result.LDLRA.PBIL <- StrLearningPBIL_LDLRA(J35S515,
  seed = 123,
  ncls = 5,
  method = "R",
  elitism = 1,
  successiveLimit = 15
)
result.LDLRA.PBIL
```

### Local Dependence Biclustering

Local Dependence Biclustering combines biclustering and Bayesian network models. The model requires three main components:

- Number of latent classes/ranks
- Field assignments for items
- Network structure between fields at each rank

Here's an example implementation:

```{r setup-ldb}
# Create field configuration vector (assign items to fields)
conf <- c(1, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 4, 7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 9, 10, 10, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 9, 9, 10, 1, 1, 7, 9, 10)

# Create edge data for network structure between fields
edges_data <- data.frame(
  "From Field (Parent) >>>" = c(
    6, 4, 5, 1, 1, 4, # Class/Rank 2
    3, 4, 6, 2, 4, 4, # Class/Rank 3
    3, 6, 4, 1, # Class/Rank 4
    7, 9, 6, 7 # Class/Rank 5
  ),
  ">>> To Field (Child)" = c(
    8, 7, 8, 7, 2, 5, # Class/Rank 2
    5, 8, 8, 4, 6, 7, # Class/Rank 3
    5, 8, 5, 8, # Class/Rank 4
    10, 10, 8, 9 # Class/Rank 5
  ),
  "At Class/Rank (Locus)" = c(
    2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, # Class/Rank 2
    3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, # Class/Rank 3
    4, 4, 4, 4, # Class/Rank 4
    5, 5, 5, 5 # Class/Rank 5
  )
)

# Save edge data to temporary file
edgeFile <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
write.csv(edges_data, file = edgeFile, row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r setup-ldb-conf, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Fit Local Dependence Biclustering model
result.LDB <- LDB(
  U = J35S515,
  ncls = 5, # Number of latent classes
  conf = conf, # Field configuration vector
  adj_file = edgeFile # Network structure file
)

# Display model results
print(result.LDB)
```


Additionally, as mentioned in the text (Shojima, 2022), it is often the case that seeking the network structure exploratively does not yield appropriate results, so it has not been implemented.
```{r}
result.LDB <- LDB(U = J35S515, ncls = 5, conf = conf, adj_file = edgeFile)
result.LDB
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
# Clean up temporary file
unlink(edgeFile)
```

Of course, it also supports various types of plots.

```{r plot-ldb, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Show bicluster structure
plot(result.LDB, type = "Array")
# Test Response Profile
plot(result.LDB, type = "TRP")
# Latent Rank Distribution
plot(result.LDB, type = "LRD")
# Rank Membership Profiles for first 9 students
plot(result.LDB, type = "RMP", students = 1:9, nc = 3, nr = 3)
# Field Reference Profiles
plot(result.LDB, type = "FRP", nc = 3, nr = 2)
```

In this model, you can draw a Field PIRP Profile that visualizes the correct answer count for each rank and each field.

```{r plot-ldb-fieldpirp, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(result.LDB, type = "FieldPIRP")
```

### Bicluster Network Model

Bicluster Network Model: BINET is a model that combines the Bayesian 
network model and Biclustering. BINET is very similar to LDB and LDR.

The most significant difference is that in LDB, the nodes represent the fields, whereas in BINET, they represent the class. BINET explores the local dependency structure among latent classes at each latent field, where each field is a locus.

To execute this analysis, in addition to the dataset, the same field correspondence file used during exploratory Biclustering is required, as well as an adjacency matrix between classes. 

```{r setup-binet}
# Create field configuration vector for item assignment
conf <- c(1, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 7, 7, 11, 11, 7, 7, 12, 12, 12, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 12, 1, 1, 6, 10, 10)

# Create edge data for network structure between classes
edges_data <- data.frame(
  "From Class (Parent) >>>" = c(
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, # Dependencies in various fields
    2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
    6, 6, 11, 8, 9, 12
  ),
  ">>> To Class (Child)" = c(
    2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 11, # Target classes
    3, 7, 9, 12, 12,
    10, 8, 12, 12, 11, 13
  ),
  "At Field (Locus)" = c(
    1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, # Field locations
    5, 5, 5, 5, 5,
    7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 12
  )
)

# Save edge data to temporary file
edgeFile <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
write.csv(edges_data, file = edgeFile, row.names = FALSE)
```

The model requires three components:

1. Field assignments for items (conf vector)
2. Network structure between classes for each field
3. Number of classes and fields

```{r model-binet, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Fit Bicluster Network Model
result.BINET <- BINET(
  U = J35S515,
  ncls = 13, # Maximum class number from edges (13)
  nfld = 12, # Maximum field number from conf (12)
  conf = conf, # Field configuration vector
  adj_file = edgeFile # Network structure file
)

# Display model results
print(result.BINET)
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
# Clean up temporary file
unlink(edgeFile)
```

Of course, it also supports various types of plots.

```{r plot-binet, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Show bicluster structure
plot(result.BINET, type = "Array")
# Test Response Profile
plot(result.BINET, type = "TRP")
# Latent Rank Distribution
plot(result.BINET, type = "LRD")
# Rank Membership Profiles for first 9 students
plot(result.BINET, type = "RMP", students = 1:9, nc = 3, nr = 3)
# Field Reference Profiles
plot(result.BINET, type = "FRP", nc = 3, nr = 2)
```

LDPSR plot shows all Passing Student Rates for all locally dependent classes compared with their respective parents.


```{r plot-binet-ldpsr, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Locally Dependent Passing Student Rates
plot(result.BINET, type = "LDPSR", nc = 3, nr = 2)
```
