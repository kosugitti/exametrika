\item{U}{Either an object of class "exametrika" or raw data. When raw data is given,
it is converted to the exametrika class with the \code{\link{dataFormat}} function.}

\item{ncls}{Number of latent classes to identify (between 2 and 20). Default is 2.}

\item{na}{Values to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Missing indicator matrix of type matrix or data.frame. Values of 1 indicate
observed responses, while 0 indicates missing data.}

\item{w}{Item weight vector specifying the relative importance of each item.}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of EM algorithm iterations. Default is 100.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, displays progress during estimation. Default is TRUE.}

\item{beta1}{Beta distribution parameter 1 for prior density of class reference matrix. Default is 1.}

\item{beta2}{Beta distribution parameter 2 for prior density of class reference matrix. Default is 1.}

\value{
An object of class "exametrika" and "LCA" containing:
\describe{
\item{msg}{A character string indicating the model type. }
\item{testlength}{Length of the test (number of items).}
\item{nobs}{Sample size (number of rows in the dataset).}
\item{Nclass}{Number of latent classes specified.}
\item{N_Cycle}{Number of EM algorithm iterations performed.}
\item{converge}{Logical value indicating whether the algorithm converged within maxiter iterations}

\item{CMD}{Class Membership Distribution vector showing the sum of membership probabilities for each latent class.}
\item{Students}{Class Membership Profile matrix showing the posterior probability of each examinee
belonging to each latent class. The last column ("Estimate") indicates the most likely class assignment.}

represents a latent class. Values indicate the probability of a correct response
for members of that class.}

\description{
Performs Latent Class Analysis (LCA) on binary response data using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
LCA identifies unobserved (latent) subgroups of examinees with similar response patterns,
and estimates both the class characteristics and individual membership probabilities.
}
\details{
Latent Class Analysis is a statistical method for identifying unobserved subgroups within
a population based on observed response patterns. It assumes that examinees belong to one
of several distinct latent classes, and that the probability of a correct response to each
item depends on class membership.

The algorithm proceeds by:
\enumerate{
\item Initializing class reference probabilities
\item Computing posterior class membership probabilities for each examinee (E-step)
\item Re-estimating class reference probabilities based on these memberships (M-step)
\item Iterating until convergence or reaching the maximum number of iterations
}

Unlike Item Response Theory (IRT), LCA treats latent variables as categorical rather than
continuous, identifying distinct profiles rather than positions on a continuum.

# Fit a Latent Class Analysis model with 5 classes to the sample dataset
