\arguments{
\item{U}{U is either a data class of exametrika, or raw data. When raw data is given,
it is converted to the exametrika class with the \link{dataFormat} function.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods.}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}

\item{nrank}{number of latent rank}

\item{method}{Specify either "SOM" or "GTM".}

\item{mic}{Monotonic increasing option. The default is FALSE.}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of iterations. default is 100.}

\item{BIC.check}{During estimation with SOM}

\item{seed}{random seed for SOM}

\item{verbose}{verbose output Flag. default is TRUE}

\item{trapezoidal}{Specifies the height of both tails when using a trapezoidal
prior distribution. Must be less than 1/nrank. The default value is 0, which
results in a uniform prior distribution.}

\item{eps}{Convergence threshold for parameter updates. Default is 1e-4.}

\item{minFreqRatio}{Minimum frequency ratio for response categories (default = 0).
Categories with occurrence rates below this threshold will be excluded from analysis.
For example, if set to 0.1, response categories that appear in less than 10\% of
responses for an item will be omitted.}

item mean, standard deviation, item-total correlation, and corrected item-total correlation}

\description{
A function for estimating Latent Rank Analysis. This is a generic function that
dispatches to specific methods depending on the response type of the data:
\itemize{
\item For binary data (LRA.binary): Estimation using either SOM or GTM method
\item For ordinal/rated data (LRA.ordinal): Estimation using GTM method
\item For nominal data (LRA.nominal): Estimation using GTM method
