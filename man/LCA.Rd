\usage{
LCA(U, ncls = 2, na = NULL, Z = NULL, w = NULL, maxiter = 100, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{Either an object of class "exametrika" or raw data. When raw data is given,
it is converted to the exametrika class with the \code{\link{dataFormat}} function.}

\item{ncls}{Number of latent classes to identify (between 2 and 20). Default is 2.}

\item{na}{Values to be treated as missing values.}

\item{Z}{Missing indicator matrix of type matrix or data.frame. Values of 1 indicate
observed responses, while 0 indicates missing data.}

\item{w}{Item weight vector specifying the relative importance of each item.}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of EM algorithm iterations. Default is 100.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, displays progress during estimation. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
An object of class "exametrika" and "LCA" containing:
\describe{
\item{msg}{A character string indicating the model type. }
\item{testlength}{Length of the test (number of items).}
\item{nobs}{Sample size (number of rows in the dataset).}
\item{Nclass}{Number of latent classes specified.}
\item{N_Cycle}{Number of EM algorithm iterations performed.}
\item{converge}{Logical value indicating whether the algorithm converged within maxiter iterations}
\item{TRP}{Test Reference Profile vector showing expected scores for each latent class.
Calculated as the column sum of the estimated class reference matrix.}
\item{LCD}{Latent Class Distribution vector showing the number of examinees assigned to each latent class.}
\item{CMD}{Class Membership Distribution vector showing the sum of membership probabilities for each latent class.}
\item{Students}{Class Membership Profile matrix showing the posterior probability of each examinee
belonging to each latent class. The last column ("Estimate") indicates the most likely class assignment.}
\item{IRP}{Item Reference Profile matrix where each row represents an item and each column
represents a latent class. Values indicate the probability of a correct response
for members of that class.}
\item{ItemFitIndices}{Fit indices for each item. See also \code{\link{ItemFit}}.}
\item{TestFitIndices}{Overall fit indices for the test. See also \code{\link{TestFit}}.}

\description{
Performs Latent Class Analysis (LCA) on binary response data using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
LCA identifies unobserved (latent) subgroups of examinees with similar response patterns,
and estimates both the class characteristics and individual membership probabilities.
}
\details{
Latent Class Analysis is a statistical method for identifying unobserved subgroups within
a population based on observed response patterns. It assumes that examinees belong to one
of several distinct latent classes, and that the probability of a correct response to each
item depends on class membership.

The algorithm proceeds by:
\enumerate{
\item Initializing class reference probabilities
\item Computing posterior class membership probabilities for each examinee (E-step)
\item Re-estimating class reference probabilities based on these memberships (M-step)
\item Iterating until convergence or reaching the maximum number of iterations
}

Unlike Item Response Theory (IRT), LCA treats latent variables as categorical rather than
continuous, identifying distinct profiles rather than positions on a continuum.

\donttest{
# Fit a Latent Class Analysis model with 5 classes to the sample dataset
result.LCA <- LCA(J15S500, ncls = 5)

# Display the first few rows of student class membership probabilities
head(result.LCA$Students)

# Plot Item Response Profiles (IRP) for items 1-6 in a 2x3 grid
# Shows probability of correct response for each item across classes
plot(result.LCA, type = "IRP", items = 1:6, nc = 2, nr = 3)

# Plot Class Membership Probabilities (CMP) for students 1-9 in a 3x3 grid
# Shows probability distribution of class membership for each student
plot(result.LCA, type = "CMP", students = 1:9, nc = 3, nr = 3)

# Plot Test Response Profile (TRP) showing expected scores for each class
plot(result.LCA, type = "TRP")

# Plot Latent Class Distribution (LCD) showing class sizes
plot(result.LCA, type = "LCD")

# Compare models with different numbers of classes
# (In practice, you might try more class counts)
lca2 <- LCA(J15S500, ncls = 2)
lca3 <- LCA(J15S500, ncls = 3)
lca4 <- LCA(J15S500, ncls = 4)
lca5 <- LCA(J15S500, ncls = 5)

# Compare BIC values to select optimal number of classes
# (Lower BIC indicates better fit)
data.frame(
  Classes = 2:5,
