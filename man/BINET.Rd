\arguments{
\item{U}{U is either a data class of exametrika, or raw data. When raw data is given,
it is converted to the exametrika class with the \link{dataFormat} function.}

\item{Z}{Z is a missing indicator matrix of the type matrix or data.frame}

\item{w}{w is item weight vector}

\item{na}{na argument specifies the numbers or characters to be treated as missing values.}

\item{conf}{For the confirmatory parameter, you can input either a vector with
items and corresponding fields in sequence, or a field membership profile
matrix. In the case of the former, the field membership profile matrix will be generated internally.
When providing a membership profile matrix, it needs to be either matrix or data.frame.
The number of fields(nfld) will be overwrite to the number of columns of this matrix.}

\item{ncls}{number of classes}

\item{nfld}{number of fields}

\item{g_list}{A list compiling graph-type objects for each rank/class.}

\item{adj_list}{A list compiling matrix-type adjacency matrices for each rank/class.}

\item{adj_file}{A file detailing the relationships of the graph for each rank/class,
listed in the order of starting point, ending point, and rank(class).}

\item{verbose}{verbose output Flag. default is TRUE}

It indicates which path was obtained from which parent node(class) to
which child node(class), held by \code{parent}, \code{child}, and \code{field}. The item
Items contained in the field is in \code{fld}. Named \code{chap} includes the
conditional correct response answer rate of the child node, while \code{pap}
contains the pass rate of the parent node.}

classes of Class c. A more comprehensible arrangement of \code{params.}}

\description{
Bicluster Network Model: BINET is a model that combines the Bayesian
network model and Biclustering. BINET is very similar to LDB and LDR.
The most significant difference is that in LDB, the nodes represent
the fields, whereas in BINET, they represent the class. BINET
explores the local dependency structure among latent classes at each
latent field, where each field is a locus.
